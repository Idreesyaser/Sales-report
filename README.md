In this project, we developed a dynamic and informative Power BI report utilizing an Excel file as the data source from the AdventureWorks SQL Server database. Leveraging Power BI's robust features, including data connection from the Excel file, data modeling, and DAX query language, we created visually appealing and easily interpretable visualizations and summary tables. The focus was on ensuring that the Power BI report fully met the client's needs and expectations, providing valuable insights and supporting decision-making effectively. This project demonstrated the efficiency and versatility of Power BI in business analytics and reporting, regardless of the data source, delivering clear and informative reports.
